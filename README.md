Exploring GeoDjango tutorial to test PostGIS features using PostgreSQL DB 


## Setting up GeoDjango in on Windows OS
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/gis/install/#libsettings
1. Launch Application Stack Builder (ASB) and download PostGIS.
2. Install psycopg2-binary to interface between Python and PostgreSQL db.
3. Launch OSGeo4W installer to install PROJ.4, GDAL, and GEOS libraries for GeoDjango

Purpose is to further explore GIS and location aware applications and familiarize myself with GeoDjango usage.

Will also test other technologies that compliment usage.
